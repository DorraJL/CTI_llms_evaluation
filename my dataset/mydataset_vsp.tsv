A vulnerability in the sftunnel functionality of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain the device registration hash. The vulnerability is due to insuﬃcient sftunnel negotiation protection during initial device registration. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by CVSS v4.0 Examples  https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/ 5 of 75 intercepting a speciﬁc ﬂow of the sftunnel communication between an FMC device and an FTD device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt and modify the sftunnel communication between FMC and FTD devices, allowing the attacker to modify conﬁguration data sent from an FMC device to an FTD device or alert data sent from an FTD device to an FMC device. v 3 . 1 v 4 . 0 B a s e 8.1	Analyze the following CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score.
